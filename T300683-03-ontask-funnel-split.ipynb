    "We'll treat these separately from other sessions and exclude them from further analysis. In other words, while users in these sessions might've accepted the suggestion, gone to the caption stage, then gone back to reject it and confirm the rejection, we'll ignore \"accept then caption\" part of their session when we later look at that part of the funnel. Getting a deeper understanding of this kind of behaviour would be possible if we switch from a funnel perspective to a flow perspective, meaning that we only look at pairwise transitions between states in the workflow. We'll leave that for a future analysis.\n",
