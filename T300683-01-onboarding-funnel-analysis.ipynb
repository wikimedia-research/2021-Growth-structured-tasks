    "# Add an Image Funnel Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The phabricator task for this work is [T300683](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T300683)\n",
    "\n",
    "We're doing a similar analysis as we did for Add a Link. In the process, we'll apply some of our learnings from that analysis. Things to keep in mind are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Carefully define the steps of the funnel in such a way that it translates into a straightforward SQL query.\n",
    "* Figure out if there are certain questions that are answered by calculating user proportions (e.g. the overarching key question of task completion is not necessarily covered by the funnel, but should instead allow for users to start the task multiple times.\n",
    "* The funnel does not end with a completed edit, but with the open question of whether the edit was reverted.\n",
    "* The number of users on mobile vs desktop was unexpected. Turns out that it might be because desktop users are asked to set topics and tasks to activate the module, whereas mobile users have immediate access to random tasks. We might therefore want to consider starting the funnel earlier (e.g. Visits Homepage) so that we can understand the path to clicking a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Add a Link discussion, we get a lot of notes about possible paths and such, \"how many users do X?\", \"how many do X then Y?\", etc… These are always interesting, but will be either outside the scope of this analysis, or need to be answered with specific queries.\n",
